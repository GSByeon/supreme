"""
Build coordinate paths from common geometric shapes.

A coordinate path is an ordered collection of coordinates,
as calculated from some parametric function.  Provided functions
include common geometric shapes, like lines, circles and BÃ©zier
curves.

The path coordinates are discretised to the grid (always integer
values), and contain no adjacent duplicates (however, duplicates may
occur in the total path if the parametric curve crosses itself).
