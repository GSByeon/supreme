Introduction
------------

SupReMe, short for Super Resolution Methods, is a library
that implements the algorithms necessary to perform super-resolution
imaging.

Super-resolution imaging is a process whereby several low-resolution
photographs of a single object are combined to form a single,
high-resolution reconstruction.

An overview of the underlying theory is given in the accompanying
dissertation.
